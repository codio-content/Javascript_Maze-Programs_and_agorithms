Our current tea-making algorithm is rather simple. Let's now take a look at how to make a more sophisticated cup of tea.

This time, we are using a **flow-chart** rather than a list of instructions. You can see the flow chart on the left. You can scroll up and down to see it all.

|||definition
A flow-chart is a graphical way of showing the steps of the algorithm.

Here are the steps that are represented in the flow-chart. Notice how the steps are much clearer, especially as we have some decisions in there that mean the sequence of steps is no longer a straight line. We'll talk about this on the next page.

1. Switch on the kettle
1. Get a clean cup
1. Put a tea bag into the cup
1. Do you take sugar? If so, add it, otherwise skip to the next step
1. Has the kettle boiled? If not, then wait, otherwise add the water.
1. Let the tea brew.
1. Remove the tea bag an throw away.
1. Do you take milk? If so, add milk otherwise drink it.
